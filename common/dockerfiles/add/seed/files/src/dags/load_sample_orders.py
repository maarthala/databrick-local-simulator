"""Pipeline: reload bronze.sample_orders by running the notebook load_sample_orders.ipynb.

Lives in your dags/ folder (files/src/dags in your bucket) — Airflow picks it up in ~30 s.
The task runs your notebook from notebooks/ as you (your own lakehouse, `iceberg`), cell by
cell; if a cell fails, the task fails and its log shows which one.

Run it: Airflow → __USER___load_sample_orders → switch it on → ▶ Trigger.
