# Databrick Local Simulator

A hands-on Data Engineering learning environment — a **governed lakehouse**
(RustFS object storage, Apache Polaris governed Iceberg catalog, Spark, Trino, Superset, Airflow,
Jupyter) that you can run two ways with the **same stack**:

## 📚 Training course

Read the hands-on **Data Engineering course** online — build the ShopFlow
Bronze→Silver→Gold lakehouse and map every skill to Databricks, Snowflake & Fabric:

**→ [maarthala.github.io/databrick-local-simulator](https://maarthala.github.io/databrick-local-simulator/)**

Start with **Prerequisites & setup** and **Bring up the stack**, then work through the units.
The stack's landing page links straight to this course, so it's always the current version.

## 💬 Community & help

Join our **Discord** to discuss the stack, get help with setup or problems, and connect

## Setup — pick your environment

### 🖥️ [Local (Docker Compose)](./local/README.md)
Run the whole governed lakehouse on a single machine with Docker Compose.
Fastest to start; great for learning and offline use.
→ **[local/README.md](./local/README.md)**

### ☸️ [Kubernetes](./k8s/README.md)
The same stack on a MicroK8s/Kubernetes cluster via a Helm umbrella chart, with a
one-command Ansible bootstrap (build-and-import for locked-down nodes, or pull from
a registry for bigger clusters).
→ **[k8s/README.md](./k8s/README.md)**

## Repository layout
```
local/    Docker Compose stack + its setup, config, and challenges (Tasks.md)
k8s/      Helm chart (k8s/helm) + Ansible bootstrap (k8s/ansible)
common/   Shared by both: Dockerfiles for the custom images, the Polaris seed
          (common/polaris), and the Polaris Console build (common/polaris-console)
```

Both environments deploy the **same governed-lakehouse component set** and are
self-contained (each runs its own Postgres). What differs is only the orchestrator
(Compose vs Kubernetes) and the hostnames (localhost ports vs `*.de.lan` ingress).

## Major releases & integrations
Notable additions — a new tool, data source, or capability — are logged here so you
can see what's new at a glance. This is **not** a per-commit changelog; only
integration-level updates (like AdventureWorks or SQLPad) get an entry.

| Date | Release / integration | What it adds | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-02 | **Tool-neutral platform names & sharing** | Object storage is the service `storage` (`http://storage:9000`, root `admin` / `admin123`) — swap the S3 store without touching clients; admin account `manager` (group `managers`); second local account `learner2`; learners share a namespace or table read/write on **My catalogs** (6.1 rewritten around it); Postgres on a named volume; code-only lab images on dated tags | local · k8s |
| 2026-10-02 | **Learner workspace & course on it** | Default account `demouser`; bucket laid out like a Fabric lakehouse (`files/src`, `files/source`, `tables/`); starter kit (practice CSVs, `bronze.sample_orders`, a load notebook + DAG); `lab_spark()` / `run_notebook()` so learner DAGs write their own lakehouse; learner catalogs in Trino → SQLPad/Superset; every lesson rewritten and run as `demouser` | local |
| 2026-10-01 | **Single sign-on for every tool** | One lab account (Keycloak) for Jupyter, Airflow, Superset, SQLPad, Polaris Console and the RustFS console; instructors are admins everywhere | local · k8s |
| 2026-10-01 | **JupyterHub — one Jupyter per learner** | Per-learner Jupyter (DockerSpawner locally, KubeSpawner on k8s) with `iceberg` = own lakehouse and `shared` = the course lake; `notebooks/` + `dags/` mirrored to the learner's bucket | local · k8s |
| 2026-10-01 | **RustFS object store (replaces MinIO)** | S3-compatible, Apache-2.0; per-learner bucket `<user>-lake` (100 MB quota, own-bucket policy); **My files** page | local · k8s |
| 2026-10-01 | **My catalogs + learner DAGs** | Learners create catalogs and share namespaces/tables (read/write, revoke); Airflow loads every learner's `dags/` (dag_id prefix `<user>_`) | local · k8s |
| 2026-10-01 | **Learner front door (Keycloak)** | Landing page behind a Keycloak login / self-registration (oauth2-proxy); each learner gets their own Polaris lakehouse (`<name>_lake`, owner) + read-only shared lake on first login (home-api) | local · k8s |
| 2026-10-01 | **Delta SQL + table maintenance** | Delta SQL extension + DeltaCatalog enabled (`VACUUM`, `OPTIMIZE … ZORDER BY`, `DESCRIBE HISTORY`); Iceberg compaction / z-order / snapshot expiry / orphan cleanup verified from Spark + Trino; default Spark catalog now in-memory (no Hive Metastore) | local · k8s |
| 2026-09-30 | **Materialized views in `%%sql`** | `CREATE / REFRESH / DROP / SHOW MATERIALIZED VIEW` in notebooks, via Spark 4.1 Declarative Pipelines; results governed in Polaris (lesson 4.5) | local · k8s |
| 2026-09-29 | **Stack upgrade (Spark 4.1)** | Spark 4.1.3 + Iceberg 1.11 + Delta 4.4, Trino 483, Airflow 3.3.2, Superset 6.1, Polaris 1.8, Postgres 18; images pinned (only polaris-console on `:latest`); MinIO + mc mirrored to GHCR | local · k8s |
