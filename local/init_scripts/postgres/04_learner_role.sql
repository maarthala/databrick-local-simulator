-- The members' PostgreSQL login: learner / learner — READ-ONLY, like a production database
-- that data engineers may query but never change:
--   * reads every table in shopflow and adventureworks (the shared OLTP sources)
--   * can't insert, update, delete or create anything (writes go to the member's lakehouse)
--   * can't open the platform databases (Polaris, Keycloak, Airflow, Superset …) — the
--     superuser `postgres` is for the platform only.
-- Idempotent: also run against an existing stack (psql -U postgres -f …).
